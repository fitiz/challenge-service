This project aims to enhance user engagement and competitiveness by implementing location-based challenges and real-time leaderboards, encouraging users to participate and track their progress within these challenges actively.

#### 
  - Publishes step-count topic to Kafka (by simulator just for now, there will be a separate endpoint for the producer)
  - Uses Flyway + jOOQ
  - Create challenge:
     - ```POST /api/challenges```
  - Participate in challenge:
     - ```POST /api/challenges/{challengeId}/participants/{userId}```
  - Claim challenge reward:
     - ```POST /api/challenges/{challengeId}/participants/{userId}/rewards```

_Please see the [ChallengeManager](https://github.com/fitiz/challenge-service/blob/main/src/main/java/com/fitiz/challenge/service/ChallengeManager.java) , [LeaderboardRedisProvider](https://github.com/fitiz/challenge-service/blob/main/src/main/java/com/fitiz/challenge/provider/LeaderboardRedisProvider.java) detailed implementation_

*This service was later separated into challenge-service and leaderboard-websocket-service. Some codes are still here even though they were used in the leaderboard-websocket-service and other consumer services.

#### UI

- Live Mode, users can initiate a WebSocket (STOMP) connection and subscribe to the challenge-specific channel
